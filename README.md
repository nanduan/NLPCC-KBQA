# NLPCC-KBQA

People frequently asked me "where can I download" the NLPCC-KBQA datesets used in previous NLPCC Open Domain QA Evaluations from 2016 to 2018. So I just put these 4 files here, including:
- **nlpcc2016-2018.kbqa.train**. It includes 24,479 training instances, each of which is consist of (i) **a knowledge triple** in the form of <subject entity, relation, object entity> and (ii) a natural language question labeled by human based on the subject entity and relation, with the object entity as its answer.
