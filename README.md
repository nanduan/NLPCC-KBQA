# NLPCC-KBQA

People frequently asked me "where can I download" the NLPCC-KBQA datesets used in previous NLPCC Open Domain QA Evaluations from 2016 to 2018. So I just put these 4 files here, including:
- **nlpcc2016-2018.kbqa.train**. This file includes 24,479 training instances, each of which is consist of (i) a knowledge triple in the form of <subject entity, relation, object entity> and (ii) a natural language question labeled by human based on the subject entity and relation, with the object entity as its answer.
- **nlpcc2016.kbqa.test, nlpcc2017.kbqa.test, nlpcc2018.kbqa.test**. These 3 files are used as the KBQA testsets in NLPCC 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Please note that, the 2017 testset doesn't provide the knowledge triple infor for each test instance.
